The data structure we used are priority_queue for queuing and scheduling. A request is put into a priority_queue when the queuing happens. The comparator is set according to the scheduling algorithm wanted.
Upon scheduling, we just need to use the top of the queue.
Vector for multithreading and our own implementation of semaphore/mutex for synchronization.

Context switch: Since the scheduling algorithms required in this project are not preemptive, we do not need to make a context switch during executing the task. 
However, different threads in this program voluntarily gets switched out by waiting for a socket connection, waiting for input and semephore etc. We included STL thread library so 
the context switching is done by the UNIX system myhttpd is running on.

Race condition is avoided by protecting the shared resources with mutex. In our case, the request queue is the shared resource, where working threads and the queuing/shceduling thread want to access and modify them. 
Only one thread is allowed to access the priority_queue at a time.

We initiate worker threads and server socket connection in main function and wait for client reaponse in a while loop. Then we initiate a queuing thread to listen for client connection. When receiving a client's request,
the scheduling thread will parse the input stream and instantiate a struct, which stores the information about the request.
After a certain period, release the worker threads which will take requests from the ready queue.
Advantages: All the threads are protected and good use of CPU. Server can take many clients are handle many requests.
Disadvantage: The struct that we used to store request information might have overheaded work.
